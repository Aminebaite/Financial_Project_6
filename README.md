Proptech, the application of technology to real-estate markets, is an innovative domain in the fintech industry. We assume that we're an analyst at a proptech company that wants to offer an instant, one-click service for people to buy properties and then rent them. The company wants to have a trial of this offering in the San Francisco real-estate market. If the service proves popular, they can then expand to other markets.
Our job is to use our data visualization skills, including aggregation, interactive visualizations, and geospatial analysis, to find properties in the San Francisco market that are viable investment opportunities.


For this Project, we will need to create and submit the following deliverable:
A Jupyter notebook that contains our analysis of the housing rental market data for San Francisco. The analysis will be complete with professionally styled and formatted interactive visualizations.
